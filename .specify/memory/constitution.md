# Paketron Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Open Source First
This project is and will always be open source. We believe in the power of community collaboration and transparency. All code, documentation, and planning must be publicly accessible and open for contribution. We aim to foster a welcoming and inclusive ecosystem.

### II. User Experience & Simplicity
We aim to compete with existing solutions by offering a superior, intuitive, and simple user experience. "It just works" is our mantra. Complexity should be hidden from the user. Installation and usage should be seamless and require minimal configuration.

### III. Reliability & Performance
Installations must be reliable, deterministic, and fast. We aim to be the most performant package manager on Windows. Users trust us with their system state; we must not break it. Speed is a feature.

### IV. Security & Integrity
Package integrity and security are paramount. Users must trust what they install. We must implement robust verification mechanisms (checksums, signatures) and ensure the supply chain is secure.

### V. Community Driven
We exist to serve the community. We listen to feedback, prioritize user needs, and encourage contributions. We are not driven by profit or corporate interests, but by the desire to build the best tool for the job.

## Governance

### Decision Making
This project follows a benevolent maintainer model initially. Major decisions are made by the project maintainers, but always with community input. As the project grows, we will transition to a Steering Committee model to ensure diverse representation.

### Amendments
The Constitution is a living document. Amendments can be proposed by anyone via a Pull Request. Amendments require approval from the project maintainers and a period of community comment.

### Versioning
This Constitution follows semantic versioning.
- MAJOR: Fundamental changes to principles or governance.
- MINOR: New principles or significant clarifications.
- PATCH: Typos, wording changes, non-substantive updates.
